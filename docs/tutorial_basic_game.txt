VoidRay Tutorial: Creating a Basic Game
=======================================

This tutorial will walk you through creating a complete basic game using VoidRay,
covering fundamental concepts and common patterns you'll use in game development.

What We'll Build
----------------
A simple top-down game where the player controls a blue square, avoiding red enemies
that move randomly around the screen. When the player touches an enemy, they respawn
at the center of the screen.

Prerequisites

```python
import voidray
from voidray import *
from voidray.physics.collision import BoxCollider
import random
