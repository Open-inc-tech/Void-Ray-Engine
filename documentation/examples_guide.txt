VoidRay Game Engine - Examples Guide
====================================

This guide explains the example games included with VoidRay and how to use them to learn game development concepts.

OVERVIEW OF EXAMPLES
===================

The VoidRay examples are designed to demonstrate different aspects of game development:

1. basic_game.py - Fundamental concepts
2. platformer_demo.py - Physics and collision handling
3. space_shooter.py - Advanced game mechanics

Each example builds upon concepts from the previous ones, so it's recommended to study them in order.
