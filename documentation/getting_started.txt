VoidRay Game Engine - Getting Started Guide
==========================================

Welcome to VoidRay, a lightweight 2D game engine built with Python and Pygame!

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
------------------
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Pygame 2.0+ (automatically installed with pip)
- Cross-platform: Windows, macOS, Linux

INSTALLATION
-----------
1. Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed on your system
2. Install Pygame: pip install pygame
3. Download or clone the VoidRay engine
4. The engine is ready to use - no compilation required!

QUICK START - YOUR FIRST GAME
-----------------------------
Let's create a simple game in just a few lines of code:

1. Create a new Python file (e.g., my_game.py)
2. Add this code:

```python
from voidray import Engine, Scene, Sprite, Vector2
from voidray.graphics.renderer import Color

# Create a simple player sprite
class Player(Sprite):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__("Player")
        self.create_colored_rect(32, 32, Color.BLUE)

# Create the main game scene
class GameScene(Scene):
    def on_enter(self):
        player = Player()
        player.transform.position = Vector2(400, 300)
        self.add_object(player)

# Create and run the game
engine = Engine(800, 600, "My First VoidRay Game")
scene = GameScene()
engine.set_scene(scene)
engine.run()
