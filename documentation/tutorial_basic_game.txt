VoidRay Game Engine - Basic Game Tutorial
=========================================

This tutorial will guide you through creating a complete game from scratch using VoidRay. We'll build a simple collection game where the player moves around collecting items while avoiding enemies.

WHAT WE'LL BUILD
---------------
- A player character that moves with keyboard input
- Collectible items that appear randomly
- Enemies that move in patterns
- Score tracking and game over conditions
- Basic particle effects
- Sound effects (optional)

STEP 1: PROJECT SETUP
---------------------
1. Create a new directory for your game: mkdir my_collection_game
2. Create the main game file: my_game.py

Start with this basic structure:

```python
import sys
import os
# Add VoidRay to path (adjust if needed)
sys.path.insert(0, '../voidray')

from voidray import Engine, Scene, Sprite, Vector2, Keys
from voidray.graphics.renderer import Color
from voidray.physics.collider import RectCollider
import random
import math

# We'll add our classes here

def main():
    engine = Engine(800, 600, "Collection Game")
    scene = GameScene()
    engine.set_scene(scene)
    engine.run()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
